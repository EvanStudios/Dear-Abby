<h1>Dear Abby,</h1>
  <p>Since the dawn of time…</p>
  <p>Nope, that’s overused. </p>
  <p>Roses are red, violets are—</p>
  <p>also overused.</p>
  <p>You’re the one who’s amazing with words in this relationship. However, I will do my best in writing to a writer— No AI handicap. 
  <p>Since our first three-hour call, I knew you were incredibly special. We talked about our similar life journeys and how we had nearly crossed paths many times.
    This was followed by me begging you to share details of your time at the Galactic Starcruiser (I promise that’s not the only reason I’m with you). 
    I was immediately swept up by your intelligence, your passion, and your genuineness. I have never been so instantly hooked by a person I had just met. 
    After our first call, I sat completely stunned. Following some reflection time, I called my Ma and was barely able to formulate complete sentences. 
    I could not stop talking about you. I told her that I had never had a better call in my life, and that you were someone special. 
    You radiate with a spark of life that I will never tire of. That night I didn’t get much sleep because I was too busy wondering if you were real.</p>
  <p>In the months that followed, your realness was confirmed ten-fold.</p>
