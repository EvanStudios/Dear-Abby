<h1>Dear Abby,</h1>
  <p>You are the one who is amazing with words. However, I will do my best in writing a letter to a writer— No AI handicap. 
  <p>Since our first three-hour call, I knew you were incredibly special. We talked about our similar life journeys and how we had nearly crossed paths many times.
    This was followed by begging for details of your time at the Galactic Starcruiser (I promise that is not the only reason I am with you). 
    I was immediately swept up by your intelligence, your passion, and your genuineness. I have never been so instantly hooked by a person I had just met. 
    After our first call I sat there completely stunned. Following some reflection time, I called my Ma and was barely able to formulate complete sentences. 
    I could not stop talking about you. I told her that I had never had a better call in my life, and that you were someone special. 
    You radiate with a spark of life that I will never tire of. That night I didn’t get much sleep because I was too busy wondering if you were real.</p>
  <p>In the months that followed, your realness was confirmed a thousand-fold. Instead of work giving me fullfilment and joy, it quickly became you. You became the most precious, cherished, and important piece of my life. Everyday I am discovering more and more, just how shiny you are. </p>
  <p>I feel a tremendous amount of peace at the thought of going through life's hurdles with you. I admire so many things about you, and our ability to communicate so beautifully is one of them. I respect and trust you so much.</p>
  <p>If you ever find yourself doubting the kind of person you are, remember this. You have a gracious, generous, thoughtful, caring, kind, and beautiful soul. You are a person who puts other's needs before your own. Your warmth is a magnet for those who have the privilege of being in your life.</p>
  <p>Thank you for choosing me to be the lucky recipient of your kindess, grace, and love. I believe with all my heart that when I asked God to take the wheel, he showed me the way to you. </p>
  <p>Every Christmas season please remember that your laughter rings brighter than Santa's sleighbells, and your eyes are warm enough to melt the North Pole.</p>
  <p>I love you very much Abby,</p>
  <p>- Love, Evan</p>
